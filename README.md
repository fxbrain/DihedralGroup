# DihedralGroup

There are only two groups with 10 elements: the integer modulo 10 and the group of symmetries of a 
regular pentagon, a dihedral group denoted by ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1409256968/render.png). J.Verhoeff had the inspiration of looking at 
![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1409256968/render.png) in order to come up with a perfect check-digit scheme.

The group consists of the identity, four counterclockwise rotations (72˚, 144˚, 216˚and 288˚), and 
the five reflections about perpendiculars from a vertex to the opposite side.

This application of ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1409256968/render.png) involves digits, so we use 0 for the identity, 1-4 for the four rotations, 
and 5-9 for the reflections.
